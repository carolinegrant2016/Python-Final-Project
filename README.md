# Python-Final-Project
PURPOSE

There are two primary purposes of this project: 
1. To gain familiarity with data visualization using multiple python packages, specifically matplotlib and plotly
2. Work with a large dataset (>1,000,000 datapoints)

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

1. Visualize drug related deaths across the United States of America in 2015
2. Visualize crime in Chicago from 2012-2017

METHODS

I used two datasets from Kaggle.com
1. https://www.kaggle.com/yuqizheng/drug-related-deaths-analytics/data (drug_induced_deaths_1999-2015.csv)
2. https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago/data (Chicago_Crimes_2012_to_2017.csv)
